## Your Task

The Day Planner was created to display a simple calender application where we can showcase previous skills with HTML/CSS and utilize JQuery as well. We were tasked with creating it so that is would display an array of hours throughout the day that could connect to a your actual time of day and provide you the ability to save and revisit what you have already input.

It was a fun assignment to see how the components worked together and as you can see when you visit the application, present time is highlighted in red, our past hours are greyed out as they are no longer present and then our future hours are a 'Go!' or green.

Please enjoy!


## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## Helpful Hints:
*Use Time Blocks
*Review Local storage and how to display after refresh
